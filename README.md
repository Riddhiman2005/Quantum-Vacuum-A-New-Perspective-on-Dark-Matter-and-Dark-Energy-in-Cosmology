# Dark Matter #

Introduction

Humans have an insatiable need to understand the world around them, from the origins of our own existence to the vastness of the universe. Yet, despite all the progress we've made, there are still mysteries that elude us. 

For centuries, scientists have looked up at the night sky and marveled at the luminous matter that seemed to make up our universe. However, in the past century, experiments and observations have revealed that there must be something else out there that we cannot see. The existence of this mysterious substance, known as dark matter, has been theorized to explain the discrepancies in our current understanding of the universe.

Despite the fact that we have yet to directly observe dark matter, we have compelling indirect evidence for its existence. The search for dark matter is not just about explaining the anomalies in our observations but has much wider implications. It has the potential to help us understand the origins of the universe and the ultimate fate of the cosmos. While the universe may be vast and seemingly endless, the enigma of dark matter has captured the attention of scientists and laypeople alike.

Dark matter is not just a puzzle to solve, but a gateway to unlocking some of the biggest questions in the field of Cosmology and astrophysics.

Background

Everything we touch, smell, taste,eat or see is composed of the same sort of atoms as the thousands of billions of stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy in which we live. This same sort of atoms make up the stars, dusts and gases that compose the hundreds of billions of other galaxies in our visible Universe, or also the the gas which lies in the intergalactic depths.

Despite the fact that everything we experience in our daily lives is made up of the same sort of atoms, it's important to remember that these atoms are just a fraction of the stuff that makes up the universe. In fact, if we were to add up all the matter and energy in the universe, the sum total of everything we can see, from the tiniest speck of dust to the largest galaxy, would only account for less than 5% of the total. The vast majority of the universe is composed of something entirely different from the matter that makes up our world.

It's a humbling realization that the stuff that we're made of is such a small part of the universe as a whole. But it also highlights just how much we have yet to learn about the cosmos. The study of dark matter and dark energy is just one example of the ongoing quest to understand the mysteries of the universe. As we continue to explore and push the boundaries of what we know, it's exciting to imagine what other discoveries and revelations may be waiting for us in the vast, unexplored depths of the cosmos.

Despite its invisibility as dark matter doesn't emit light , we know that it exists because of the gravitational effects it has on other bodies in the universe, such as stars and galaxies.

Scientists have long been fascinated by the phenomenon of dark matter, which was first hypothesized to account for discrepancies between the observed mass of galaxies and the mass that could be accounted for by the visible matter they contained. Over time, more and more evidence has accumulated that supports the existence of dark matter, and it is now widely accepted as a fact of the universe.

The most popular theory to explain dark matter is that it is composed of a new type of particle known as weakly interacting massive particles(WIMPs) [We will discuss this article in details in our upcoming posts] for short. These particles are thought to interact only through gravity and the weak force, which makes them incredibly difficult to detect or observe directly.

While there are alternative theories that have been proposed to explain dark matter, there is still much that we don't know about this elusive
